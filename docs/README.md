# Enterprise Data Intelligence Blueprint


This blueprint brings together resources that capture Rivirhouse’s approach to designing and delivering Data, AI, and Governance solutions.

It is a continually evolving resource, offering insights into strategic, enterprise, and solution-level practices—distilled from our R&D, common questions, and real-world experience.

The ideas and patterns reflect Rivirhouse’s design philosophy:

- grounded in large, multi-domain enterprise deployments, yet adaptable to organisations of any size or type
- evolving, opinionated, and open to challenge
- demonstrable in working environments on request

We share this blueprint with our customer and partner community to promote our vision of 'good design', help avoid pitfalls, and speed up delivery.

We encourage you to explore, share and build on this information, with proper attribution to Rivirhouse and consideration as set out in our [license and disclaimer](#licensing-and-disclaimer).

# Overview
---

This blueprint is comprehensive and intentionally opinionated, providing practical patterns for designing and delivering enterprise-scale Data, AI, and Governance solutions. It is continuously refined through ongoing R&D, customer engagements, lessons learned, and evaluations of the evolving product landscape.

It follows an iterative approach where each level builds on the previous one, while remaining flexible to be revisited and refined as capabilities mature.

Organisations may begin at any level depending on their maturity, but all levels should be considered and validated for applicability:

1. **[Level 0: Context Setting](level_0.md)** - Define organisational objectives, domain structures, and strategic goals
2. **[Level 1: Enterprise Architecture](level_1.md)** - Apply enterprise-wide patterns and reference topologies  
3. **[Level 2: Domain Solutions](level_2.md)** - Implement domain-specific solutions using enterprise patterns
4. **[Standards & Conventions](standards_and_conventions.md)** - Apply consistent naming and conventions throughout

## Design Principles
---

<br>

>#### *“The alternative to good design is always bad design. There is no such thing as no design.” - Adam Judge*

<br>
Our approach is guided by nine foundational principles that ensure transparency in decision-making, effective trade-off evaluation, and strategic alignment. 

Readers should consider the priority and implication of these principles alongside any existing principles applicable within their organisation.
<br>

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Think big, start small** | Balance rapid delivery with strategic positioning. Deliver value iteratively. Ensure investments deliver sustained benefits without creating technical debt. |
| 2 | **Empowered Autonomy** | Enable domain experts to manage data independently while leveraging shared, scalable foundations. |
| 3 | **Disciplined Core, Flexible Edge** | Federated governance model that ensures policy consistency while enabling rapid, domain-specific delivery. |
| 4 | **Actionable Data** | Real-time, comprehensive data extraction (structured & unstructured) with platforms ready for immediate insights and AI/ML. |
| 5 | **Make It Easy to Do the Right Thing** | Provide automation and platforms that guide users toward secure, policy-aligned practices effortlessly. |
| 6 | **Cost Transparency and Efficiency** | Transparent cost models with pay-for-value usage while promoting reuse and removing sharing barriers. |
| 7 | **Adaptability for Growth** | Platforms seamlessly adapt to evolving business needs, data growth, and diverse workloads. |
| 8 | **Interoperability and Inclusion** | Smooth integration across cloud, on-premises, and diverse technology stacks (bring-your-own). |
| 9 | **Flexibility Through Standards** | Technology-agnostic, standards-based components that maintain flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in. |

<br>
<br>

## Getting Started
---

Recommended starting point by role:

| Role | Recommended Path | Focus Areas |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Leaders & Architects** | Levels 0-1 | Strategic alignment, enterprise patterns, governance frameworks |
| **Domain & Technical Teams** | Level 2 | Practical implementation within established enterprise frameworks |
